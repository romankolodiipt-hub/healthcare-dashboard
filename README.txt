Project README

Thank you for reviewing my submission!

How to run the project

This project was built using Next.js 14, React, and Tailwind CSS.
To run it locally, please follow these steps:

Install dependencies:

npm install
# or
pnpm install


Create a .env.local file in the project root.
Add the required environment variables (API keys, endpoints, etc.) for server calls. You can refer to .env.example for the expected structure.

Run the development server:

npm run dev
# or
pnpm dev


The project will be available at http://localhost:3000
.

Important Note about the HTML build

I attempted to generate a fully static HTML build, but due to limitations with Next.js 14 and browser security policies (CORS restrictions on local files, _next/static paths, and React/Tailwind integration), opening the exported HTML directly in a browser will not work properly.
To view the project as intended, please run it through the development server or a local HTTP server.

Design collaboration

During development, I worked together with another designer experienced in this field to address all design-related questions and ensure that the interface matches the intended mockup as closely as possible.

Final thoughts

It was really interesting and enjoyable to work on this mockup, and I appreciated the opportunity to bring it to life using Next.js and Tailwind CSS.
